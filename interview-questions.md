# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: 
  I'm wouldn't be able to give you a textbook definition on what `this` is but I can explain to you how I have used it in the past. I have used `this` as a keyword when working with React. It has been used to call on keys within a object inside of a class. When setting a value to a variable you would attach `this` to the object which is state and then attach the key you would like to use for the variable using dot notation.

  Researched answer:
  The keyword `this` in javascript refers to a object. When used inside of a object method `this` refers to the things inside the object. When used outside of the method and used alone or in a function it will reference the global object. So, we use `this` to easily call on keys and there values inside of an object.



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer:
  React is an application that that allows us to connect front end and back end development. It puts all the code such as HTML, CSS, and javascript together and allows us to create a user friendly website. 


  Researched answer:
  React is a javascript library that is used to create user friendly web pages. All of the elements such as functions, variables, and classes that make up React are called components and the components are reusable allowing developers not having to rewrite code. There are two types of components, display components, which hold all of the design and user interface data. While smart components hold all of the logical data such as functions. One thing what people like about React is that display components can send data up river using state.



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer:
  The life cycle method that is required would be the render method. This is because the render is the section of the code that actually displays your components on to the user interface. So, if you do not have anything inside of your render all of the components that you created would be for nothing because nothing would show up on your website.

  Researched answer:
  Render() is the required method because it is the one that outputs your HTML to the DOM. Other methods such as the setState or constructor methods are elements within your code that you would like to display through the render. So, as said before you can develope all the code you would like but with out the render you will never be able to see or use your creation. 



4. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer:
  JSX is the style of writing code that is a mix between javascript and HTML. It is the language used when coding with React. I can not tell you the exact syntax's that are different between HTML and JSX but I know that they are very similar and that they had to change some key words between the two so that the languages could work closely together.

  Researched answer:
  JSX a language used within react that is a extension of Javascript allowing developers to combine and write HTML inside of Javascript. One major difference between JSX and HTML is that when coding with JSX you have to return a single parent element or "fragment". But, when working with HTML you can have multiple fragments.



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer:
  I do not remember the exact definition for Yarn but I can explain how its worked when I have used it. When creating a new React application you write yarn create react-app with the name of what you would like to call the app. Yarn downloads all of the necessary files to start your React app. So, yarn acts as a key word to start your app or compiler of the information and code within a react app. The file that I have modified within React is usually the App.js or App.css.

  Researched answer:
  Yarn is a package manager that has a primary function of installing a piece of global code that serves a particular purpose. That is why we use this when starting up a new React App, yarn installs all of the default elements that make up React. This allows for easier and more efficient code when merging with other developers because it allows each developer to the exact same type file structure across all machines. The files with in the src are modified to the fit the React Application default standards.
